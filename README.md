# mush.js

### Intrduction
mush.js is a project to explore the idea of implementing a MUSH in JavaScript using node.js. Technically, it would only be MUSH-like in the commands. The in-game scripting langguage would be JavaScript (using node's virtual machine facility for security).

Right now, mush.js allows players to create, connect, say, pose, quit and use the who command. All commands are lowercase. It could be considered a chat-server with some persistence.

Currently, I am flushing out the data model for the objects and adding persistence for the objects.
