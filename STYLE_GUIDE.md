Style Guide
===========

* Spaces, not tabs. (Weird, because I kinda like tabs)
* 4-space indents, not 2 or 3 or 1. (I'm old, with poor vision.)
* Use JSDOC tags on all files, functions and methods. See: http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/wiki/TagReference
* If a function is longer than 60 lines, refactor it into smaller chunks.
* This project uses OOP, keep objects simple. Very simple.
* Always add 'use strict'; in your JS files. Note: If there is a feature you want, place that code before the 'use strict'.
* Avoid deeply nested asynchronous code by functional decomposition and the async module.
* KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. 
* DRY: Don't repeat yourself.
* Validate: Make liberal use of assert & is to validate parameter types.
